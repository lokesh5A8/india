                    <p>Bharatanatyam is one of the oldest and most revered classical dance forms of India, originating in Tamil Nadu. Rooted in temple traditions, it was historically performed by devadasis (temple dancers) as a form of devotion. The dance is known for its fixed upper torso, bent legs (aramandi posture), intricate footwork, graceful hand gestures (mudras), and expressive facial expressions (abhinaya). Bharatanatyam combines rhythm, storytelling, and spirituality, often portraying themes from Hindu epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata. Today, it is performed worldwide on both religious and cultural stages, representing a rich blend of tradition, discipline, and artistic expression.</p>
